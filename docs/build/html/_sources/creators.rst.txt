Creators
********
The creators are the classes used to create all the nodes on a rig, is an easy way to create the maya nodes.
You can use your custom code to create the maya nodes, but using the creators can provide you of tools made for rigging.
This are some of the creators that I have done,  many more can be created, but so far this are the ones that I have needed or use more commonly.

I will list them in a importance order.
