How to install
==============
You can clone directly the repository from the git hub page and clone it to your user/maya/scripts folder.
In theory you could clone it to any PYTHON_PATH folder.


.. code-block:: bash

   :emphasize-lines: 6

   git clone https://github.com/rendermotion/RMPY.git

You can also download the `github desktop application <https://desktop.github.com/>`_ and clone from there.


Once the module has been installed, you can test the modules by importing RMPY writing on the terminal the following code.

.. code-block:: bash
   :caption: Cloning the repository
   :emphasize-lines: 6

   import RMPY

if get no errors on the terminal, this means that you are ready to start creating rigs.
first I would recomend loading the shelf that is found in RMPY/Tools/shelfs
