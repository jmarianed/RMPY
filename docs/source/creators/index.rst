Creators
========

All creators inherit from a base class called creator. Which provides similar creation functions for the creators class.
In general, classes should return pymel nodes directly of the object created.

The creators are the classes used to create all the nodes on a rig, is an easy way to create the maya nodes.
You can use your custom code to create the maya nodes, but using the creators can provide you of a rig point of view creator thinking.
These are some of the creators that I have done,  many more can be created, but so far this are the ones that I have needed or use more commonly.

Here you can find a list of creators with their documentation and some examples of how to use them.
